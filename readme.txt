Run multilingual e-commerce sites with Easy Digital Downloads and Polylang

== Description ==

EDD Polylang lets you run light-weight and digital shops, with electronice-only delivery, in multiple languages.

This is a glue plugin, that uses hooks in both [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) and [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/).

It will let you run a complete shop and easily translate everything.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'edd-multilingual' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Before creating products, you should configure how you want to treat 'edd_download_files' (copy or translate) in Polylang -> Translation Managemenet -> Multilingual Content Setup. This is because some stores have the same files for all languages while others dont, so you need to configure this manually.
